WRONG CODE:
a=5
b=6
print(a+B)


3.check the wrong code in pycharm terminal by entering the following line:
  pylint simple1.py -r y
  
4.after entering this we will encounter our rate out of 10 and basic tables to show our error.
5.then rectify the code and follow the same steps as 1 and 2.

RECTIFIED CODE
'''
a very simple script
'''


def my_func():
    '''
    a simple function
    '''

    first = 2
    second = 3
    print(first)
    print(second)


my_func()


6.then we will see that our score has improved a lot from the previous score.

****NOTE*****
THE FILE MUST BE IN pythonProjects OF pycharm_project FOR EASY ACESS IN TERMINAL.
