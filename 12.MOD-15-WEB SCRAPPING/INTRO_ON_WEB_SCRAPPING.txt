2.u can right click on a website and select "view page source" to get an example
3.HTML syntax

<!DOCTYPE html>                                  -----------------------#general html doc tag
<html>                                           ----------------#starting tag
    <head>                                       ----------------#head start
     <title>Title on Browser Tab</title>                 ---------------#title tags         
    </head>                                      ----------------#head end(with frward slash)
    <body>
        <h1> Website Header </h1>                        ----------------#header tags

4.head portion of HTML file contains certain high level of information like title of browser tab,heading or connection to things like another CSS file
5.body of HTML file contains vast majority of info that the website is going to display


CSS:
1.CSS stands for Cascading style sheets and it gives style to a website such as changing fonts and colours
2.CSS uses tags to define what HTML elemsnts will be styled
3.CSS link in HTML file:


<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
     <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">        ----#CSS linked file-here link rel means link relation and href means reference here
    <title>Some Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p id=‘para2’> Some Text </p>              -------#the body of HTML file is linked to the particular para of CSS file
    <body>
</html>


4.when any HTML file is linked to CSS then it contains certain ids and classes
5.the .css file syntax:(for id)


#para2 {
    color: red;
}


6.here the hashtag in CSS file clearly defines that it is id and id are only used for HTML file once.
7.CSS link in HTML file:


<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
     <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    <title>Some Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p class=‘cool’> Some Text </p>
    <body>
</html>


8.the .css file syntax:(for class)


.cool {
    color: red;
    font-family: verdana; 
}


9.the dot in CSS file clearly defines that it is class and class can be used in HTML file multiple times
10.larger CSS code:


p{                                    -----#p-defines that all paragraph elements in HTML must be of this colour,font and font-size
    color: red;
    font-family: courier;
    font-size: 160%;
}
.someclass{                            ------------#./period-defines that the single paragraph must be of this code
    color: green;
    font-family: verdana;

}
#someid{
    color: blue;                      ----------#hashtag-defines that a single element in HTML file must be of this colour
